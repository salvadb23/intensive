#Let's Make History
## A site to motivate voters and simplify the voting process 

I first began trying to build the main part of Let's Make History, the voter guide and news section but the skills I currently have didn't really translate well into building that. So for my first intensive project I decided to try and build a great-looking Landing Page using techniques I learned in my Front-End class.

## Design Process

I first began researching how people designed sign-up pages and really liked the pages that split the page in half with a hero image on one side and a sign up page on the other. The issue I ran into when trying to build this kinda sign-up page 
was it was difficult to add information without making the page look cluttered so I decided to jsut make a 3 section page with a hero image, a section with informtaion and a sign up section. 

## Techniques Used

I used Flexbox for the entire layout, I had used Grid previously but hadnt really built aything with Flexbox and thought this would be a great time to try. It offered me a lot of flexibility and I feel more confident in using flexbox now. I struggled getting the site to be somewhat responsive, I managed to get it to be used on about 2 screen sizes but getting it to work on mobile is more difficult then I thought.
